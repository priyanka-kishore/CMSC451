Shortest Paths in Weighted Graphs
------------------------------------

BFS can find shortest paths in unweighted graphs.
What if there's a weight w_uv >= 0 for each edge (u, v) in E?

One idea:
1)  make edges longer
    
    u ---(3)--- v   =>   u -- x -- x -- v added imtermediates
    
    - increases input size (esp. with highly weighted edges)
        - thus greater running time
    - messy for non-integer weights

2) Greedy algo: Dijkstra's! (next note)
