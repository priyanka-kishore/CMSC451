Scheduling to Minimize Lateness - Proof
------------------------------------
- scheduling tasks in order of increasing deadline
- proof by exchange argument

DEFINITION:
* a schedule has an "INVERSION" if job i comes before job j, but deadlines d_i > d_j.

- in our greedy algo, no inversions
    - scheduling by INCREASING deadline
- anything out of order = an INVERSION


LEMMA
------------------------------------
All schedules with no inversions (and no idle time) have the same maximum lateness.

Proof:
------
The only flexibility in such a schedule (with no inversions) is in the order of jobs with the same deadline.
Any such jobs must be scheduled consecutively.
The finishing time of the last job in the block (of all jobs that have the same deadline) doesn't depend on the order.

LEMMA
------------------------------------
There is an optimal schedule with no inversions (and no idle time).

Proof:
------
By exchange argument. We show how to convert an optimal schedule with inversions into one with none.

If there's an inversion, there must be jobs i,j (with i before j) that are adjacent and have d_i >  d_j.

We claim that swapping jobs i & j gives a schedule with one less inversion and no worse lateness.

        |       |     [i            ][j   ]
        d_j     d_i   s_i        f_i=s_j  f_j
        <----------- lateness ------------>
        - before swap, lateness if f_j - d_j

        |       |     [j   ][i            ]
        d_j     d_i   s_i  s_i+t_j       f_j
                         = s_i + f_j - s_j
        - after swap, lateness is
            l = max(f_j - d_i, s_i + f_j - s+j - d_j)
                                ^ = f_j - d_j - (s_j - s_i)
                                                 ^ = positive
    Therefore, l <= f_j - d_j since d_i > = d_j and s_j >= s_i.
    - Lateness can only go down from the value it had before swap. Performing swap can't make things worse.

    Repeat until get a scedule with no inveresions, without making the lateness worse.

By the previous lemma, this optimal schedule has the same lateness as the greedy one.
