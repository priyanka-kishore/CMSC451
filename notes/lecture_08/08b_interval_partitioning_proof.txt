Interval Partitioning Proof
------------------------------------
- proving algorithm is correct
    - use smallest number of colors


THEOREM
------------------------------------
GreedyIntervalPartition assigns a color from {1, 2, ... , depth} to all intervals and no two intervals are assigned the same color.

Proof:
------
// 1. never assign two overlapping intervals the same color

Whenever we assign a color, it's different from the colors of all overlapping intervals scheduled so far, so we never assign the same color to overlapping intervals.

// 2. why does it suffice to use the depth number of colors

To show that the # colors <= depth, it suffices to show that we never exclude all the colors.
Suppose when considering interval i, it overlaps t previous intervals.
Then there exists (t + 1) overlapping intervals, so depth >= t + 1.
=> t <= depth - 1, so there is always a color from {1, ... , depth} available. 
// aka if the # colors used is just depth, the # prev intervals is depth - 1, a color always available
