Closest Points
------------------------------------
- divide and conquer!
- computational geometry

Given n points in the plane, find the closest pair.

Brute force? 
------------
O(n^2) - compute each distance between all points, keep track of smallest

Efficient?
----------

Try this simpler case: n points in a LINE
    - we know that the closest point to a given point is either on left or right
    - in CONSTANT time, can sort, then go thru all points and check both sides
        - sort: O(nlogn)
        - check: O(n)

SO - can we take some idea from this 2D case into 3D case?
