Kruskal's Algorithm
------------------------------------

Greedy rule: Add the lowest-weight edge that doesn't create a cycle (repeat until have ST).


Proof (that output is spanning tree):
------
Suppose the algorithm adds edge e = {u,v} to the forest F.

Consider the cut induced by the component of u in F.
// aka everything that can be reached by u is a component of u and will be the A part of the cut; B will be everything else

Vertex v is on the other side of the cut since adding e doesn't create a cycle (according to greedy rule).
// when e is added to F, no cycle is created bc before adding the edge e, there was no path from u to v

By the greedy rule, e is the min-weight edge crossing the cut.

So by the lemma, every MST must contain e.

It remains to show that the output is a spanning tree.
Clearly it never creates a cycle.
If the graph were not connected, there would be an edge it could add without creating a cycle, so it would be finished.
Thus, the final output is a spanning tree.
