Prim's Algorithm
------------------------------------
- Finding MST of weighted graph.
- Prove with same lemma as Kruskal's which shows that every edge added by the algo has to be in any MST.

Greedy Rule: Choose any root and grow a tree by adding the non-tree vertex with lowest attachment cost.

THEOREM:
------------------------------------
Prim's algorithm outputs an MST.

Proof:
------
Suppose the algo adds edge e = {u,v} to forest F.

Consider the cut induced by the component of the root in F.

Clearly, e crosses this cut, and by the greedy rule, it's the min-weight edge with this property.

So by the lemma, every MST contains e.

Clearly, the algo outputs a spanning tree since as long as F is not connected (as long as there are some vertices not yet attached to growing tree), we can add some edge and not create a cycle.
